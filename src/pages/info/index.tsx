              </p>
              <p>
                I WASN &apos;T SURE WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE. INITIALLY, I THOUGHT MY PROFESSION WOULD BE RELATED TO THE RAILWAY INDUSTRY. AND BEFORE DELVING INTO THE WORLD OF WEB DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN, I ALSO WORKED AS A WAITER.  <br /> <br />
              </p>
              <p>
                AS A JUNIOR WEB DEVELOPER I REALIZED THAT I ENJOYED THE CREATIVE ASPECT OF MY WORK MORE, AND I MADE A FULL TRANSITION INTO THE FIELD OF DESIGN. SINCE THEN, I HAVE WORKED AS A FREELANCER ON PLATFORMS LIKE UPWORK AND COLLABORATED WITH COMPANIES AND CLIENTS ON A FULL-TIME OR CONTRACT BASIS. Iâ€™VE WORKED WITH PROMINENT COMPANIES AND CLIENTS.
